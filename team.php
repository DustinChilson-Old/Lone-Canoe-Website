                      <p>Chris has published newsletters over the last several years for various scouting groups 
                        with volumes from 250 to 800 newsletters each with 4-8 pages.  He also specializes in "at 
                        event" newsletters (where the writing, pictures, and publication is complete within 3-6 hours 
                        during the event.) </p>
                      <p>Special event planning and production solutions are possible in part because of Chris's 
                        experience with theater mechanics.  Chris has produced several medium scale productions 
                        (1000-2000 attendance) with casts as large as 50 members. </p>
